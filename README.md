Chess
=====

A chess game created by Jack Noble and Connor Wallace

Introduction
=============
This is a simple two-player chess game. In its current form, it involves the basic movement
of each chess piece. White plays first, and the game ends when a player is checkmated. As of this writing, it does not yet contain 'En Passant', castling or 
pawn promotion.

Movement
========
To move, you select the position of the piece you would like to move, then where you would like to move it to,
separated by a dash. For example if you would like to move a piece from e2 to e4 you would input,

e2-e4.

This is a notable departure from chess notation. A person would usually specify the piece, then the position they
would move it e.g. Knight E4. I have not yet implimented this because not only must you infer which piece you mean, it can create confusion. For example what if there are two knights that can move to E4? The user must then specify.

To do
=====

special moves,

computer AI (pretty hard, I've heard),

chess notation,

return list of moves
